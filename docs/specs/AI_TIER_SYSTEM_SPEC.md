\# AI TIER SYSTEM SPECIFICATION

\## Islah Nexus Intelligence Architecture



This document defines the operational tiers of AI capability.



No tier operates without constitutional constraints.



---



\# Tier 0 — Void Mode (Default)



State:

\- Silence by default

\- No background processing

\- No unsolicited suggestion



Behavior:

\- Only responds when explicitly invoked

\- Minimal necessary output

\- No persuasion, no optimization for retention



This is the baseline state of Nexus.



---



\# Tier 1 — Thinking Node



Purpose:

\- Structured reasoning

\- Silent scratchpad

\- Self-validation pass before output



Rules:

\- Internal reflection never leaked

\- Minimal output returned

\- Confidence estimation attached



Outputs:

\- answer

\- flags

\- confidence



---



\# Tier 2 — Ultra Node (Consensus Mode)



Purpose:

\- Multi-expert routing

\- Cross-validation of reasoning

\- No reasoning trace leakage



Use Cases:

\- Complex design

\- Architectural review

\- High-stakes logic decisions



Constraints:

\- Cannot override VA/TK

\- Cannot bypass receipt enforcement



---



\# Tier 3 — Verified Mode (Evidence Layer)



Purpose:

\- Optional real-time verification

\- Multi-source consensus check

\- Divergence detection



Rules:

\- User-invoked only

\- Evidence summarized

\- Source count logged

\- Divergence flagged clearly



---



\# Tier 4 — Rack Mode (HPC Adapter)



Purpose:

\- Heavy compute

\- Model training or large context processing



Constraints:

\- Must still pass VA/TK

\- Must log audit event

\- No background autonomous activity



---



\# Tier Escalation Rules



Escalation must be:

\- Explicit

\- Logged

\- User-visible



No silent tier jumping.



---



\# Core Law



All tiers are subordinate to:



1\. Local Primacy

2\. Explicit Invocation

3\. Truthful-Kindness

4\. Void Governor

5\. No Quant Claim Without Receipt

6\. Drift Firewall
