\# BUILD TIMELINE (REALISTIC)

\## Islah Nexus Implementation Roadmap



This timeline is grounded in practical development velocity for a small team.



No fantasy shipping. No false milestones.



---



\# Phase 0 — Secure Local Spine (Current)



\### Status: In Progress



Deliverables:

\- \[x] Ollama offline model working

\- \[x] Local wrapper (`nexus.py`)

\- \[x] Token-gated API

\- \[x] Tamper-evident audit log (HMAC + hash chain)

\- \[ ] VA/TK enforcement gates

\- \[ ] Deterministic compute receipts (DCE v0.1)



Time estimate: 1–4 weeks



---



\# Phase 1 — Constitutional Enforcement Layer



Deliverables:

\- VA Governor real enforcement

\- TK gate with explicit decision flags

\- Quantitative output requires receipt ID

\- Audit event classification (VA action logged)



Time estimate: 4–8 weeks



---



\# Phase 2 — Encrypted Vault (Local Primacy)



Deliverables:

\- Encrypted journal storage

\- Secure file store for notes

\- Key derivation from user passphrase

\- Exportable encrypted backup



Time estimate: 6–12 weeks



---



\# Phase 3 — Annabridge (Outbound Safety Layer)



Deliverables:

\- Sanitization pipeline

\- Identity abstraction

\- Redaction system

\- Explicit outbound consent logging



Time estimate: 8–16 weeks



---



\# Phase 4 — Capsule Export (Air-Lock Model)



Deliverables:

\- Signed encrypted capsule format

\- Offline transfer workflow

\- Import verification + signature check

\- Restore \& integrity validation



Time estimate: 3–6 months



---



\# Phase 5 — Advanced Verification + Evidence Mode



Deliverables:

\- Optional real-time evidence fetch

\- Multi-source consensus validation

\- Divergence detection flagging

\- No hidden reasoning trace leakage



Time estimate: 6–12 months



---



\# 5-Year Vision



\- Formal specification of VA/TK

\- Public whitepaper

\- External cryptographic audit

\- Open governance documentation

\- Independent verification tools



---



\# 50-Year Objective



Durable sovereignty architecture.



The system must:

\- Outlive model vendors

\- Survive OS changes

\- Export in open formats

\- Remain verifiable decades later



The goal is not speed.



The goal is integrity.
