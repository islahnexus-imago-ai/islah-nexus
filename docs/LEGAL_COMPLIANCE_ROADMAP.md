\# LEGAL \& COMPLIANCE ROADMAP

\## Islah Nexus



This document clarifies what Islah Nexus claims, what it does not claim, and how compliance evolves over time.



---



\# 1. Current State (MVP)



Islah Nexus (current local wrapper stage) is:



\- A local-only AI wrapper

\- Running on user-controlled hardware

\- Not a hosted service

\- Not collecting user data

\- Not monetizing user behavior



At this stage:



\- No external data processing agreements required

\- No user data storage beyond local machine

\- No telemetry

\- No silent sync



Security model: local isolation + token-gated API + tamper-evident logs.



---



\# 2. Cryptography Claims



Important distinction:



\*\*FIPS-aligned design ≠ FIPS compliant.\*\*



Compliance requires:

\- Validated cryptographic modules

\- Formal certification process

\- Documentation + audit procedures



Future path:

\- Adopt validated crypto libraries

\- Maintain compliance documentation

\- Engage external audit partners



---



\# 3. Privacy Position



Islah Nexus commits to:



\- Local primacy by default

\- Explicit invocation for outbound requests

\- No background data export

\- Full user control over export/delete



If Annabridge (external AI calls) is used:

\- Explicit user invocation required

\- Sanitization layer active

\- Logged outbound request hash



---



\# 4. Regulatory Awareness (Future Phases)



If offered commercially:



\- GDPR considerations

\- Data processor vs data controller clarity

\- Right-to-erasure implementation

\- Transparent audit logs for users



---



\# 5. Non-Claims



We do NOT claim:



\- Military-grade security

\- Certified compliance

\- Absolute protection against compromised OS

\- Protection against physical device seizure



We claim:



\- Honest architecture

\- Minimal attack surface

\- Explicit boundaries

\- Transparent logging



---



\# 6. Governance Intention



Long-term:



\- Publish whitepaper

\- Define constitutional governance model

\- Open verification tooling

\- Independent code audits



Compliance is not marketing.



Compliance is documentation plus verification.

# LEGAL \& COMPLIANCE ROADMAP

\## Islah Nexus Governance Path



This document separates:

\- What we technically enforce

\- What we legally claim

\- What we formally certify



No inflated compliance language.



---



\# Current State (MVP)



Enforced:

\- Local-only default operation

\- No silent sync

\- Explicit invocation

\- Tamper-evident audit chain



Not yet certified:

\- FIPS validation

\- ISO compliance

\- SOC 2

\- GDPR formal audit



Important distinction:

"FIPS-aligned cryptography" ≠ "FIPS compliant system"



Compliance requires:

\- Validated cryptographic modules

\- Certified build processes

\- Formal documentation

\- Audit trails



---



\# Phase 1 — Transparent Technical Claims



All public claims must:

\- Match enforceable behavior

\- Avoid marketing exaggeration

\- Use precise language



Examples:

\- "Local-only by default"

\- "Tamper-evident audit log"

\- "Token-gated access"



Avoid:

\- "Military-grade"

\- "Unhackable"

\- "Fully compliant"



---



\# Phase 2 — Formal Documentation



Deliverables:

\- Threat model document

\- Data flow diagrams

\- Key management policy

\- Secure development lifecycle doc

\- Incident response outline



---



\# Phase 3 — External Review



\- Cryptographic audit

\- Code review by external engineers

\- Compliance readiness assessment



---



\# Phase 4 — Optional Certifications



Depending on use-case:

\- GDPR alignment

\- HIPAA (if medical)

\- SOC 2 (if SaaS deployment)

\- FIPS validation pathway



---



\# Non-Negotiable Principle



We do not claim compliance we have not earned.



Trust is built by:

\- Verifiability

\- Auditability

\- Transparency

\- Scope honesty



Compliance is a process.

Integrity is a constant.
